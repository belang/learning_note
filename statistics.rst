Regularization
==============

Regularization is a way to avoid Overfitting_ by penalizing high-valued regression coefficients.

Overfitting
===========

Overfitting is where your model is too complex for your data — it happens when your sample size is too small.
If you put enough predictor variables in your regression model, you will nearly always get a model that looks significant.

While an overfitted model may fit the idiosyncrasies of your data extremely well,
it won’t fit additional test samples or the overall population.
The model’s p-values, R-Squared and regression coefficients can all be misleading.
Basically, you’re asking too much from a small set of data.
