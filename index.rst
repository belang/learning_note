Loihi
-----

Loihi can solve LASSO optimization problems with over three orders of magnitude
superior energy-delay product compared to conventional solvers running on a CPU isoprocess/voltage/area.
This provides an unambiguous example of spike-based computation,
outperforming
all known conventional solutions.
